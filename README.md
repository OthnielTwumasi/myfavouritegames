# myfavouritegames
Trying to replicate the layout for this site I visited but repurposing it for a list of my favourite games. I want to be able to learn how to  copy the fonts from the site and also maybe do a bit of flexbox I guess and lastly semantic html ofc

# inspiration
I took inspiration from https://cs.fyi/guide/writing-semantic-html in terms of layout
and then https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-reviewed-games-of-2024 in terms of how the images were placed
